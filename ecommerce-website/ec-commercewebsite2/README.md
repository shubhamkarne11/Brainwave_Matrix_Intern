# TrendZone E-Commerce

Welcome to **TrendZone**, a fully responsive e-commerce website built from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a modern online shopping experience with a focus on clean design and user-friendly functionality.

No frameworks or libraries were used in this project, except for **Glide.js** to power the carousels for a smooth sliding experience.

- **Dynamic Navigation**: Includes a mobile-friendly menu and mega-menu dropdowns for easy browsing.
- **Interactive Elements**: Features a hero carousel, product sliders, and a search overlay.

  - Basket (`basket.html`): Shopping cart with subtotal and shipping options.
  - News (`articles.html`): Blog-style articles section.
